      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For our second blog post in this series, let's dive into setting up your
        own ecommerce store using Big Cartel. Big Cartel is designed with
        simplicity in mind, making it perfect for artists and small businesses
        looking to create an online presence quickly and easily. Starting with
        Big Cartel is straightforward - simply sign up for a free account,
        choose your shop name, and verify your email. Once your account is set
        up, you'll be guided through a simple checklist to complete your store
        setup. This includes adding your products, setting up shipping options,
        and connecting your payment processor. The user-friendly interface
        ensures that even those with minimal technical skills can navigate the
        setup process without any hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big Cartel also offers a range of customization options to help you
        create a store that reflects your brand. You can choose from various
        themes and personalize your store's design, ensuring it stands out and
        captures your unique style. Adding products is a breeze, with options to
        import multiple products at once or add them individually. The platform
        supports various product options and categories, making it easy to
        organize your inventory. Shipping can be customized at both the product
        level and storewide, providing flexibility to meet your business needs.
        Plus, with integrations for PayPal and Stripe, you can easily accept
        payments from customers. Once your store is ready, deploying it to the
        world is just a click away. With Big Cartel, setting up an ecommerce
        store is not only simple but also enjoyable, allowing you to focus on
        what you do best - creating and selling your unique products.

        It's important to set this up for proper sales tax calculations. You can
        always change this later by going to the

        This is not a marketing strategy walkthrough. It would benefit you to do
        some research on product naming and description techniques to take
        advantage of search engines as product names are indexed and
        descriptions improve searchability. Check out

        One thing that is great about Big Cartel is how simple the product page
        is. It's limited but straightforward which makes your product setup
        easy. Add categories to organize your products and assist your customers
        in finding what they are looking for. If you have different sizes,
        colors, or materials, add a
        <a
          href="https://www.bigcartel.com/resources/help/article/create-product-options"

        or

          >variant group</a
        >
        to your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will add a variant group today. Click the
        <span class="italics">Add variant group</span> button and select Get
        started.
      </p>

        alt="big cartel shop setup checklist screen update"
      />
      <p>
        In this case, Ink Flow Studio is selling different sized art, so
        naturally, our variant group is named Size. We list out all the sizes
        with optional dimensions like 24 inches by 36 inches. You can move the
        list around or delete any list items.

      />
      <p>
        Once your variant group is the way you want it. Big Cartel will create
        the product listing for you and all the variations will be listed on
        your product page.

      <h2>Ship your Customer Products</h2>
      <p>
        You have two options when setting up your shipping: individual
        product-level or storewide profiles.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Product-level Shipping</h3>
      <p>
        You can add shipping rates for each product based on size and weight.
        You have room to be creative like “each additional item” shipping cost.

        >. You can run your shop with one service connected but having both will
        give you more options to accept payments. It also will help prevent
        payment issues if one service is down. If you use Stripe, you can accept
        in-person payments using the Big Cartel app.

        Some ecommerce platforms charge a commission on each sale. Big Cartel
        does not charge any listing for transaction fees which helps keep more
        money in your pocket. Big Cartel is required to withhold sales tax which
        show up on statements as a “Partner Commission” or “Application Fee."
        This is not a transaction fee. PayPal and Stripe have their own
        transaction fees. To learn more, see
